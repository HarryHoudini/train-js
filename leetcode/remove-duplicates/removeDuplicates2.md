This TypeScript code defines a function called `removeDuplicates2` that removes duplicates from a sorted array of numbers `nums`. The function modifies the array in place and returns the length of the array after duplicates have been removed.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Function Declaration**:
   ```typescript
   const removeDuplicates2 = (nums: number[]): number => {
   ```
   - This line declares a constant `removeDuplicates2` and assigns it a function. The function takes an array of numbers (`nums`) as its argument and returns a number.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   ```typescript
   let k: number = 1;
   ```
   - A variable `k` of type `number` is initialized to 1. This variable will be used to track the position of the next unique element in the array.

3. **For Loop**:
   ```typescript
   for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
   ```
   - This loop iterates over the array starting from the second element (index 1) to the end of the array.

4. **Condition to Check for Duplicates**:
   ```typescript
   if (nums[i] !== nums[i - 1]) {
   ```
   - Inside the loop, this condition checks if the current element (`nums[i]`) is different from the previous element (`nums[i - 1]`). If they are not the same, it means the current element is unique.

5. **Updating the Array and Incrementing `k`**:
   ```typescript
   nums[k] = nums[i];
   k++;
   ```
   - If the current element is unique, it is placed at the `k`-th position in the array (`nums[k] = nums[i]`), and `k` is incremented by 1.

6. **Returning the Length of the Array After Removing Duplicates**:
   ```typescript
   return k;
   ```
   - After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of `k`, which represents the length of the array with duplicates removed.

### Example
If `nums` is `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`, the function will modify `nums` to `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3]` and return `3`. The first three elements (`[1, 2, 3]`) are the unique elements, and the length of this unique part is `3`. The remaining elements in the array are not important because the function only returns the length of the unique part.

In summary, this function effectively removes duplicates from a sorted array by rearranging the elements and returns the length of the array after removing the duplicates.
